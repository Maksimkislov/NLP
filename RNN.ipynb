amsterdam s schiphol airport decided to decorateeach bathroom urinal with a realistic image of a fly placed just above the drain for decades urinal designers had sought a way to curb the unpleasant spillage around urinals and it turned out that by giving men something to aim at in this case a humble insect spillage dramatically reduced this airport innovation went on to become one of the most well known examples of a nudge a subtle prompt that can alter human behavior the formal concept of nudging was first popularized by economist richard h thaler and legal scholar cass r sunstein who co authored the best selling 2008 book nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness the book defines a nudge as something that alters people s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives the authors framed nudging as a bipartisan technocratic fix that could solve tricky policy problems while preserving individual freedom governments didn t need to tell people what to do they needed to nudge them following the book s publication nudges were embraced by both the u s and u k governments and thaler went on to win the nobel prize in economics but two years after covid 19 was first detected in wuhan china nudges have lost some of their luster to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus governments and businesses have resorted to harsher measures such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates which nudges were purported to help policymakers avoid for skeptics a reassessment of nudges was overdue we shouldn t fool ourselves into thinking that nudges are going to magically fix our larger systemic issues said neil lewis jr a behavioral scientist and assistant professor at cornell university they re not nudging draws on insights from psychology primarily the work of daniel kahneman who won the nobel prize in economics in 2002 and amos tversky these two israeli psychologists pioneered the study of mental shortcuts that humans rely on to make decisions known as heuristics they presented initial findings in a 1974 paper judgment under uncertainty heuristics and biases their work had clear implications for economics which assumes that people make rational decisions in pursuit of their interests kahneman and tversky showed that that isn t how the human mind usually works beginning in the late 1970s thaler partnered with kahneman and tversky to apply their findings to his field creating behavioral economics in nudge sunstein and thaler brought behavioral science to the masses with intuitive and simple examples such as placing carrot sticks at eye level in school cafeterias to encourage healthier eating governments quickly caught on sunstein went to washington d c to work for the white house in 2009 six years later then president barack obama issued an executive orderto encourage the use of behavioral science in federal policymaking in 2010 the u k prime minister set up the behavioral insights teamwithin the government s cabinet office the team was spun off as a private company in 2014 and now has offices around the world globally there are now more than 200 teams or nudge units that specialize in applying behavioral science to everyday life nudge units had important successes in the u k the behavioral insights team sent lettersto clinics whose family doctors were overprescribing antibiotics the effort yielded a 3 percent decrease in prescriptions another initiative demonstrated the power of tweaking a message taxpayers who paid their income tax late received letterstelling them they were in a minority as nine out of 10 people pay on time that gentle admonition appears to have resulted in an additional 120 000 people paying about 6 5 million into u k government coffers and behavioral science notched another win when governmentsand companiesmade enrollment in retirement savings plans a default option helping people save more but as with any trend there are skeptics some commentators decrynudges as government overreach or as an infringement on individual autonomy but there are also peoplewho say the opposite that nudges result in governments not doing enough in 2011 the u k house of lords issued a reportthat questioned why nudges were being favored over more traditional policy tools like regulation in theory behavioral science doesn t skewleft or right but in the hands of politicians dubious of big government nudges can become a way to sidestep more muscular interventions behavioral science had a rough start during the pandemic when boris johnson decided not to impose a u k lockdown in march 2020 rumors swirled that the head of the behavioral insights team david halpern was advising againststricter measures hundreds of behavioral scientists then signed an open letterdemanding the government explain the evidence supporting its decision a subsequent inquiryby the parliament found that senior officials had opted initially for softer measures assuming incorrectly that the public wouldn t comply with a lockdown the pandemic revived a debate that has swirled around behavioral science for the past decade what can nudges achieve and what can they not a s covid 19 infections grew exponentially in 2020 behavioral scientists wanted to help nudges presented a possible route to controlling the virus particularly in the absence of vaccines and evidence based treatments said jay van bavel an associate professor of psychology at new york university that april van bavel and 41 other researchers among them sunstein published a paperthat outlined how the social and behavioral sciences could contribute from boosting trust in government policies to fighting conspiracy theories the authors were circumspect though the findings they summarized were far from settled and pre dated the covid 19 crisis research on the social dimensions of the pandemic soon began in earnest the national science foundation launched a rapid response program which could provide up to 200 000 per grant according to arthur lupia who recently completed his term as leader of the directorate for social behavioral and economic sciences the directorate processed the same number of grants over a six week period that spring as it normally does in six months the nonprofit social science research councilalso put out a call for proposals and was overwhelmed by the response out of 1 300 applications they could only fund 62 as scientists learned more about how the coronavirus spread through the air the sciencein support of social distancing and masks became clearer governments knew what they wanted their citizens to do but they still had to think carefully about how to encourage people to change their behavior that s where nudges could help researchers didn t know if nudges would work under the extreme conditions of a pandemic nudg\",\n          \"curlf revealed plans on tuesdayto open four new dispensaries in florida

Так как каждый объект может принадлежать нескольким классам, закодируйте лейблы в виде векторов из 0 и 1, где 1 означает, что объект принадлежит соответствующему классу, а 0 – не принадлежит. Имея такую кодировку, мы сможем обучить модель, решая задачу бинарной классификации для каждого

manager at amsterdam s schiphol airport decided to decorateeach bathroom urinal with a realistic image of a fly placed just above the drain for decades urinal designers had sought a way to curb the unpleasant spillage around urinals and it turned out that by giving men something to aim at in this case a humble insect spillage dramatically reduced this airport innovation went on to become one of the most well known examples of a nudge a subtle prompt that can alter human behavior the formal concept of nudging was first popularized by economist richard h thaler and legal scholar cass r sunstein who co authored the best selling 2008 book nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness the book defines a nudge as something that alters people s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives the authors framed nudging as a bipartisan technocratic fix that could solve tricky policy problems while preserving individual freedom governments didn t need to tell people what to do they needed to nudge them following the book s publication nudges were embraced by both the u s and u k governments and thaler went on to win the nobel prize in economics but two years after covid 19 was first detected in wuhan china nudges have lost some of their luster to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus governments and businesses have resorted to harsher measures such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates which nudges were purported to help policymakers avoid for skeptics a reassessment of nudges was overdue we shouldn t fool ourselves into thinking that nudges are going to magically fix our larger systemic issues said neil lewis jr a behavioral scientist and assistant professor at cornell university they re not nudging draws on insights from psychology primarily the work of daniel kahneman who won the nobel prize in economics in 2002 and amos tversky these two israeli psychologists pioneered the study of mental shortcuts that humans rely on to make decisions known as heuristics they presented initial findings in a 1974 paper judgment under uncertainty heuristics and biases their work had clear implications for economics which assumes that people make rational decisions in pursuit of their interests kahneman and tversky showed that that isn t how the human mind usually works beginning in the late 1970s thaler partnered with kahneman and tversky to apply their findings to his field creating behavioral economics in nudge sunstein and thaler brought behavioral science to the masses with intuitive and simple examples such as placing carrot sticks at eye level in school cafeterias to encourage healthier eating governments quickly caught on sunstein went to washington d c to work for the white house in 2009 six years later then president barack obama issued an executive orderto encourage the use of behavioral science in federal policymaking in 2010 the u k prime minister set up the behavioral insights teamwithin the government s cabinet office the team was spun off as a private company in 2014 and now has offices around the world globally there are now more than 200 teams or nudge units that specialize in applying behavioral science to everyday life nudge units had important successes in the u k the behavioral insights team sent lettersto clinics whose family doctors were overprescribing antibiotics the effort yielded a 3 percent decrease in prescriptions another initiative demonstrated the power of tweaking a message taxpayers who paid their income tax late received letterstelling them they were in a minority as nine out of 10 people pay on time that gentle admonition appears to have resulted in an additional 120 000 people paying about 6 5 million into u k government coffers and behavioral science notched another win when governmentsand companiesmade enrollment in retirement savings plans a default option helping people save more but as with any trend there are skeptics some commentators decrynudges as government overreach or as an infringement on individual autonomy but there are also peoplewho say the opposite that nudges result in governments not doing enough in 2011 the u k house of lords issued a reportthat questioned why nudges were being favored over more traditional policy tools like regulation in theory behavioral science doesn t skewleft or right but in the hands of politicians dubious of big government nudges can become a way to sidestep more muscular interventions behavioral science had a rough start during the pandemic when boris johnson decided not to impose a u k lockdown in march 2020 rumors swirled that the head of the behavioral insights team david halpern was advising againststricter measures hundreds of behavioral scientists then signed an open letterdemanding the government explain the evidence supporting its decision a subsequent inquiryby the parliament found that senior officials had opted initially for softer measures assuming incorrectly that the public wouldn t comply with a lockdown the pandemic revived a debate that has swirled around behavioral science for the past decade what can nudges achieve and what can they not a s covid 19 infections grew exponentially in 2020 behavioral scientists wanted to help nudges presented a possible route to controlling the virus particularly in the absence of vaccines and evidence based treatments said jay van bavel an associate professor of psychology at new york university that april van bavel and 41 other researchers among them sunstein published a paperthat outlined how the social and behavioral sciences could contribute from boosting trust in government policies to fighting conspiracy theories the authors were circumspect though the findings they summarized were far from settled and pre dated the covid 19 crisis research on the social dimensions of the pandemic soon began in earnest the national science foundation launched a rapid response program which could provide up to 200 000 per grant according to arthur lupia who recently completed his term as leader of the directorate for social behavioral and economic sciences the directorate processed the same number of grants over a six week period that spring as it normally does in six months the nonprofit social science research councilalso put out a call for proposals and was overwhelmed by the response out of 1 300 applications they could only fund 62 as scientists learned more about how the coronavirus spread through the air the sciencein support of social distancing and masks became clearer governments knew what they wanted their citizens to do but they still had to think carefully about how to encourage people to change their behavior that s where nudges could help researchers didn t know if nudges would work under the extreme conditions of a pandemic nudg\",\n          \"curlf revealed plans on tuesdayto open four new dispensaries in florida
